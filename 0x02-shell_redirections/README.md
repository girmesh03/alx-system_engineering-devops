# 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters

In this project, we will explore a powerful feature used by command line programs called input/output redirection. As we have seen, many commands such as ls print their output on the display. This does not have to be the case, however. By using some special notations we can redirect the output of many commands to files, devices, and even to the input of other commands.

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your scripts will be tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long `($ wc -l file should print 2)`
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
* You are not allowed to use backticks, `&&`, `||` or `;`
* All your files must be executable
* You are not allowed to use `sed` or `awk`
